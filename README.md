# Fraud-Detection-Model

**Project Name:** Fraudulent Transaction Detection


**Project Overview:**

The "Fraudulent Transaction Detection" project is a challenging task that calls for the development of a robust machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. With the ever-evolving landscape of digital transactions, safeguarding financial assets against fraudulent activities has become paramount.

**Project Details:**

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset, comprising 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns in CSV format. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that effectively identifies fraudulent transactions. This endeavor requires a blend of statistical analysis, creativity, and judgment to ensure the model's accuracy and actionable insights.

**Key Libraries and Tools:**

- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Preprocessing:** LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
- **Machine Learning Models:** RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier
- **Feature Engineering:** Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- **Model Evaluation:** Classification metrics, Confusion Matrix

**How to Use:**

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and encode the data for modeling.
2. Feature Engineering: Utilize techniques like VIF to identify important features.
3. Model Building: Develop machine learning models like RandomForest and Decision Trees.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using classification metrics, confusion matrices, and more.
5. Interpretation: Extract actionable insights from model results to aid in fraud detection strategies.

**Contribution:**

Contributions and improvements to this project are highly encouraged. Feel free to fork the repository, enhance the model, and share your findings and developments with the community.
